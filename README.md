## Getting started

After cloning the repo, there are a couple of initial steps;

 . Generate  exe with `go build main.go`.
   This will generate exe named as 'main'.

Now you can run the main on the target.

## Making it your own

You will need to correct the import paths for your local repo.
And remove go.mod and go.sum , init your own module name with `go mod init xx`.
